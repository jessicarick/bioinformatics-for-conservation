## Estimating genetic diversity
There are several different measures that are all considered estimates of "genetic diversity" in a population, and numerous different programs that can be used for calculating each of these. For the purposes of our class, we're going to focus on the following types of genetic diversity:
* Observed heterozygosity
* Expected heterozygosity
* Watterson's theta ($\theta$_w)
* Nucleotide diversity ($\pi$)
